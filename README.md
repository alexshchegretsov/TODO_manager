<p>The Google Tasks app is as simple as to-do list apps come. It’s a gorgeously minimal and well-designed app that does exactly what it’s supposed to and no more. You can create tasks, make a description for them, and then add subtasks. These appear in a bulleted list, and you can mark each subtask complete when the time is right. You can even set a due date for the main task. Each task sits under a list, and there’s no limit to how many lists you can create. You can have a shopping list, a to-do list, and more. In exchange for Google Tasks’ simplicity, you do lose some of the more in-depth tagging and organizational features you may find in other apps.</p>
